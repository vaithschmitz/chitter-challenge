Rails RSpec Setup:
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQ-Vf157Ju8)
	- Use gem 'rspec-rails' -> bundle install
	- instead of rspec init, rails uses generate syntax -> "rails g rspec:install"

Unlike requiring the controller (Sinatra), you require config/environment.rb in your spec_helper. config/environment.rb loads application.rb which initializes Rails through application.rb and in turn is required by config.ru to build the app. 

Testing Database:
	- "rake db:test:prepare" clones db of current env to env test
